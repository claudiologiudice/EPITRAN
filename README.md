# EPITRAN
<p align="justify"> Epitranscriptome refers to all biochemical RNA modifications affecting cellular RNAs. 
To date, >150 different RNA modifications have been discovered, and, among them, RNA editing represents the most prominent post-transcriptional mechanism. 
In mammals, it involves the deamination of cytosine to uridine or, more commonly, the conversion of adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) and, concurrently with alternative splicing, increases the diversity of the eukaryotic transcriptome and proteome.
Nowadays, RNAseq is the de facto standard approach to discover RNA editing candidates in whole eukaryotic genomes.
Although the identification of editing sites is, in principle, quite simple, it represents a computational challenge because true RNA editing events have to be discriminated from genome-encoded SNPs and technical artefacts caused by sequencing or read-mapping errors.
