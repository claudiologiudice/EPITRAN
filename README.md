# EPITRAN
<p align="justify"> Epitranscriptome refers to all biochemical RNA modifications affecting cellular RNAs. 
To date, >150 different RNA modifications have been discovered, and, among them, RNA editing represents the most prominent post-transcriptional mechanism. 
In mammals, it involves the deamination of cytosine to uridine or, more commonly, the conversion of adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) and, concurrently with alternative splicing, increases the diversity of the eukaryotic transcriptome and proteome.</p>
